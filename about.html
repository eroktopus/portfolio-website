    <div class="work-card">
      <p>
        As a burgeoning Full Stack Web Developer based in Stroudsburg,
        Pennsylvaniaâ€”just a short commute from New York City, I bring a wealth
        of diverse professional experience to the table. With nearly two decades
        of success as a Short Form Film Editor in the bustling advertising
        industry of New York, I have honed a meticulous eye for detail and a
        steadfast commitment to quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career in media has equipped me with extensive experience in
        collaborative team settings, where my hard-working ethos, dependability,
        and exceptional communication skills have always set me apart. These
        qualities not only define my professional demeanor but also enrich my
        interactions and contributions within a team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am eager to transition my broad range of skills into web
        development, seeking a role that offers opportunities for growth and
        learning. I am enthusiastic about joining a forward-thinking team, where
        I can contribute, learn, and refine my skills to excel as a web
        developer. I am driven by the challenge of solving complex problems and
        am committed to leveraging my background in creative solutions to make a
        meaningful impact in the tech industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to the opportunity to not only bring my unique
        perspective to your team but also to immerse myself in the dynamic field
        of web development, where I can truly thrive and contribute to our
        mutual success.
